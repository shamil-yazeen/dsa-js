## 🧠 Patterns Covered

### ✅ Frequency Counter

Used to compare values efficiently by counting occurrences
instead of using nested loops.

Problems implemented:

- same-frequency

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Master algorithmic patterns
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Write clean, structured solutions

---

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

Each solution includes:

- Time Complexity (Big O)
- Space Complexity (Big O)

---

## 🚀 Future Additions

- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Recursion
- Divide & Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees & Graphs
