# Frequency Counter Pattern

The **Frequency Counter** pattern is used to compare values by
counting how many times something appears.

Instead of using nested loops (O(n²)),  
we use an object, Map, or Set to store counts and solve the problem in O(n) time.

## Problems

### 1️⃣ same-frequency
Check whether two numbers contain the same frequency of digits.

### 2️⃣ are-there-duplicates
Check whether given arguments contain duplicate values.

---

## When to Use This Pattern

- Comparing two arrays or strings
- Checking permutations
- Counting occurrences
- Detecting duplicates
- Avoiding nested loops

---

## Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n)  
Space Complexity: O(n)
